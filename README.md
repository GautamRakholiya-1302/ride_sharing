# Ride-Sharing System Simulation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Ride-Sharing System Simulation.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Ride Requesting**:
   - Users can request a ride by specifying their pickup location and destination.
   
2. **Ride Acceptance**:
   - Drivers can view and accept ride requests.

3. **Driver Matching**:
   - The system matches ride requests with the nearest available driver to minimize wait times.

4. **Rating System**:
   - After the completion of each ride, users and drivers can rate each other, enhancing service quality and safety.

## Non-Functional Requirements

 **Availability and Reliability**:
   - The system is designed to be highly available and reliable, ensuring continuous service around the clock.


   - Real-time responsiveness with minimal latency is critical, allowing for immediate updates between riders and drivers.


   - Scalable architecture supports millions of users and drivers with thousands of concurrent trips without degradation of performance.



## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code files (.cpp)
- `include/`: Header files (.h)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
